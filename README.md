# MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
## The Format of CPU Instructions
### General 3-operand format
In general, MIPS instructions follow a 3-operand format, which states do the ```operation``` on ```source1``` and ```source2``` and store the result in ```destination```:

MIPS Assmebly Lanuage:
```
operation       destination, source1, source2
```

General Higher Level Programming Language:
```
destination  =  source1   operation   source2
```
